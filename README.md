# Deadfire Needful Things

## Ado Watcher!

This is a mod for Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire that adds lots of existing unique/soulbound equipment to various vendors around Neketaka.

Items that are easy to get, like Miscreant's Leathers, The Eye of Wael, Lord Darryn's Volge, Saru-Sichr etc. are not included. Likewise anything that can be bought really easily is also not added, basically anything from easily accessible stores like Dunnage, Dark Cupboard, Deck of Many Things etc.

After nearly 1600 Hours of Deadfire (nearly all upscaled Path of the Damned) I decided want some items earlier then it is possible to get in the game for RP reasons or for specific builds. I don't have the console installed or have any interest in entering console commands so I made this mod to give me access to various items early.

All this mod does is add the items to various vendors, it dos not have anything to do with the prices those vendors charge. This is something I don't want to change or see any need to. if you do not have the money for these items, go complete some bounties!
